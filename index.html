        U.S. Air Force Academy Recruitment in the Digital Age
      </h1>

      <p class="full-row">
        As one of the top-ranking colleges in the world with an acceptance rate
        of only 12%, the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is duty-bound
        to reach the best of the best through its recruitment strategy. Yet,
        finding the high-achieving students and athletes built to survive the
        rigors of military life is a needle in a haystack situation. Prospective
        students are inundated with options when it comes to choosing the path
        their education will take and with each class it becomes more
        challenging to cut through the noise. USAFA needed an extraordinary
        recruitment campaign to attract extraordinary students.

      <div class="half-row">
        <p class="half-item">
          To achieve this, we created an epic multi-part 360º simulation that
          can be experienced on desktop, headset, and (most impressively) as a
          communal immersive theater event inside the historic planetarium at
          the Air Force Academy campus outside Colorado Springs, Colorado.

          USAFA spent $5 million over a 15-year period renovating the school’s
          planetarium but they had no standing-ovation worthy material to screen
          in it. With the use of VR technology and our own proprietary
          post-processes, we designed a 360º immersive theater installation that
          allows students and their families to find out what it’s like to
          learn, live, and fly as a cadet at the United States Air Force
          Academy.

          Within months the planetarium became one of the top-rated tourist

        The cumulative edition of this campaign was in the form of an
        interactive virtual tour that can be viewed on any platform or device
        from anywhere in the world. In creating this virtual tour, we employed a
        non-linear storytelling structure that allowed users to choose their own
        adventure and behavior-driven algorithms that delivered intelligent
        calls-to-action based on each user’s personal interests.
